p1 <- "My project examines data from the NBA and MLB, analyzing the relationship
between a team's payroll and their level of success in the league."

p2 <- "Payroll is tremendously complex in professional sports because of things 
like deferred payments (when athletes are paid for current work at future 
dates); I simplified it here by treating it as the total amount that a team 
spent on its current players' salaries in a given year."

p3 <- '"Success" is examined here in a few different ways: by total wins in the 
regular season, and by metrics of post-season success (such as making the 
playoffs or winning a championship). My data shows that payroll correlates more 
closely with playoff appearances and regular season standings than it does with 
championships, indicating that teams can "buy" a certain level of success by 
paying a lot to talented players, but that it will not necessarily win them a 
championship.'

p4 <- "In the future, it would be interesting to add analysis of NFL, NHL, or 
MLS data - but for now, I'm working only with data from the MLB and NBA because 
their payroll data was publicly available and easy to access. It would also be 
interesting to look more closely into cases where teams changed 
ownership/management or location, and see if that had a significant impact on 
payroll or success, but time constraints have precluded this option for now."

p5 <- "Major thanks to Sean Lahman and the folks at Baseball Reference, who 
compiled and made available the data used in this project. See 
http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/ for the data I obtained 
from Sean, https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/ for the data scraped 
from Baseball Reference, and

for my scraping code."

p6 <- "Additional thanks goes out to Chris Davis, who compiled and made 
available the NBA payroll data used in this project, and to the folks at Land of
Basketball who compiled the team performance data I used. See 
https://data.world/datadavis/nba-salaries for salary data from Chris,

data, and
