Panes for final project

- how salaries have changed over time
- how salaries affect performance (playoffs, wins, championships, etc.)

What are all the questions my data could answer?
- after making a list and thinking them through, see what's interesting and what you actually want to learn; then work on those

# Money spent is independent variable and wins/success is dependent variable;
# trying to find out if money itself drives success, or if they tend to
# fluctuate together (e.g. because teams that do well sell more tickets and get
# more revenue and can then spend more to keep doing well)
