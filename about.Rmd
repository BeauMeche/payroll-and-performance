### About this project

My project will examine data from the MLB and the NBA, analyzing the relationship between a team's payroll and their level of success in the league. Payroll is the total amount, in a given year, that a team is spending on its players' salaries. "Success" will be examined in a few different ways: by total wins in the regular season, and by metrics of post-season success (such as making the playoffs, advancing in the playoffs, or winning a championship). If time permits, later on I might try to add analysis of NFL or NHL or MLS data - but for now, I'll stick with the MLB and NBA because their payroll data was publicly available and easy to access.

### Data I have so far and what I've done with it

About the data I've collected:
- what variables I have, what they are and why I chose them, what I'm hoping to do with them

### Plans for gathering and processing more data

Plans about what the next steps are to keep gathering data:
- when I'll know I'm done and what I'll do with what I have (what variables I want to compare, etc.)
