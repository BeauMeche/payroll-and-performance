MLB data downloaded as zip file from http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/

```{r mlb, include=FALSE}

mlb_salaries <- read_csv("raw-data/Salaries.csv")
mlb_teams <- read_csv("raw-data/Teams.csv")

glimpse(mlb_salaries)
glimpse(mlb_teams)

mlb_teams %>% 
  arrange(desc(WSWin))

```



NBA data downloaded as zip file from https://data.world/datadavis/nba-salaries

```{r nba, include=FALSE}

nba_players <- read_csv("raw-data/players.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()

nba_salaries <- read_csv("raw-data/salaries_1985to2018.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()

glimpse(nba_players) # looks not very useful for my purposes...

glimpse(nba_salaries) # could scrape data to add a few more seasons to this; it only goes up to 2017-18

team_salaries_by_season <- nba_salaries %>% 
  group_by(team, season) %>% 
  summarize(team_salary = sum(salary))

team_salaries_by_season %>% 
  arrange(desc(season))

# Still need to find data on wins, and data on playoff appearances/wins in each
# round/finals appearances/finals wins would also be nice



```

Could scrape NHL data from here if so inclined:
