# Will want to adjust all dollar values for inflation

# Could look into big/sudden changes in team spending (e.g. LAN in ~2010) to see
# if the money had an impact

# Will want to see if I can find data on total wins for the applicable time
# window, not just on division or league or WS wins

# Money spent is independent variable and wins/success is dependent variable;
# trying to find out if money itself drives success, or if they tend to
# fluctuate together (e.g. because teams that do well sell more tickets and get
# more revenue and can then spend more to keep doing well)

# Can scrape https://hoopshype.com/salaries/ for NBA data from 90/91 - 2019/20

# Or, alternatively, can try downloading dataframes from 
# https://data.world/datadavis/nba-salaries

# Could also try scraping NHL data from \
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_team_payrolls_in_the_NHL
# (small sample size though)
